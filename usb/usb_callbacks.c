// ************** USB Callback Functions ****************************************************************
// ******************************************************************************************************
// The USB firmware stack will call the callback functions USBCBxxx() in response to certain USB related
// events.  For example, if the host PC is powering down, it will stop sending out Start of Frame (SOF)
// packets to your device.  In response to this, all USB devices are supposed to decrease their power
// consumption from the USB Vbus to <2.5mA each.  The USB module detects this condition (which according
// to the USB specifications is 3+ms of no bus activity/SOF packets) and then calls the USBCBSuspend()
// function.  You should modify these callback functions to take appropriate actions for each of these
// conditions.  For example, in the USBCBSuspend(), you may wish to add code that will decrease power
// consumption from Vbus to <2.5mA (such as by clock switching, turning off LEDs, putting the
// microcontroller to sleep, etc.).  Then, in the USBCBWakeFromSuspend() function, you may then wish to
// add code that undoes the power saving things done in the USBCBSuspend() function.

// The USBCBSendResume() function is special, in that the USB stack will not automatically call this
// function.  This function is meant to be called from the application firmware instead.  See the
// additional comments near the function.

* Overview:        The USB specifications allow some types of USB
* 					peripheral devices to wake up a host PC (such
*					as if it is in a low power suspend to RAM state).
*					This can be a very useful feature in some
*					USB applications, such as an Infrared remote
*					control	receiver.  If a user presses the "power"
*					button on a remote control, it is nice that the
*					IR receiver can detect this signalling, and then
*					send a USB "command" to the PC to wake up.
*					
*					The USBCBSendResume() "callback" function is used
*					to send this special USB signalling which wakes 
*					up the PC.  This function may be called by
*					application firmware to wake up the PC.  This
*					function should only be called when:
*					
*					1.  The USB driver used on the host PC supports
*						the remote wakeup capability.
*					2.  The USB configuration descriptor indicates
*						the device is remote wakeup capable in the
*						bmAttributes field.
*					3.  The USB host PC is currently sleeping,
*						and has previously sent your device a SET 
*						FEATURE setup packet which "armed" the
*						remote wakeup capability.   
*
*					This callback should send a RESUME signal that
*                  has the period of 1-15ms.

*                  The modifiable section in this routine should be changed
*                  to meet the application needs. Current implementation
*                  temporary blocks other functions from executing for a
*                  period of 1-13 ms depending on the core frequency.
*
*                  According to USB 2.0 specification section 7.1.7.7,
*                  "The remote wakeup device must hold the resume signaling
*                  for at lest 1 ms but for no more than 15 ms."
*                  The idea here is to use a delay counter loop, using a
*                  common value that would work over a wide range of core
*                  frequencies.
*                  That value selected is 1800. See table below:
